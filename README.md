# Lab 8 - Starter
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. 
   I would have the automated tests here so that people can have their
   code automatically tested when pushed to github. It makes sure that nobody
   breaks the whole project and keeps everyone accoutable.

2. No, because you just need to check that one function's output
3. No, because you would want to test this feature from a user perspective
   if the user was able to write and send a message as expected
4. Yes you would want to use a unit text for the "max message length" 
   because it doesn't require user experience and can be easily checked
   with a unit test if the character limit works.
